1. What is source code management
2. What is Git & GitHub

5. What is a README
6. How to write good READMEs
7. How to commit
8. How to write helpful commit messages

10. How to pull updates
11. How to create a branch
12. How to merge branches
13. How to work as collaborators on a project
14. Which files should and which files should not appear in your repo

### **Source code management**
Is the practice of tracking modifications to source code. 

### `Benefits of source code management`
| ------------ | ------------ 
| Complete version history | More effective collaboration |
| Workflow automation | Better communication |
| Graphic displays of code history | Generated release notes |
| Code backup | Pipeline analytics |

### **Difference between Git and GitHub**

| S.No.     | Git      | GitHub   
| ------------- | ------------- | --------    |
| 1. | Git is a software. | GitHub is a service. |
| 2. | Git is a command-line tool. | GitHub is a graphical user interface |
|3. | Git is installed locally on the system. | GitHub is hosted on the web. |
|4. | Git is maintained by linux. | GitHub is maintained by Microsoft. |
|5. | Git is focused on version control and code sharing. | GitHub is focused on centralized source code hosting. |
|6. | Git is a version control system to manage source code history. | GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories. |
|7. | 	Git is open-source licensed. | GitHub includes a free-tier and pay-for-use tier. |

### **7 rules of a great Git commit message**
1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
